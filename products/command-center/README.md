# KarimSW Command Center

## Business Context

The Command Center is the CEO's single pane of glass for monitoring and operating the AI software company. KarimSW runs entirely through Claude Code agents — no human engineers — which means the CEO needs real-time visibility into what every agent, product, and pipeline is doing. The Command Center solves this by auto-discovering products from the filesystem, displaying agent capabilities and training status, tracking git activity across all repositories, managing CI/CD infrastructure, and providing a command invocation terminal for directing the Orchestrator. Without it, the CEO would have to manually inspect dozens of files, git logs, and GitHub Actions to understand company status.

The backend has no database — it reads all data directly from the filesystem and git CLI. This keeps the system simple and always in sync with the actual state of the monorepo.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd apps/api && npm install
cd ../web && npm install
cd ../..

# Start both services
npm run dev
```

- API: http://localhost:5009
- Web: http://localhost:3113
