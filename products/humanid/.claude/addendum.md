# HumanID — Product Addendum

## Product Overview

**HumanID** is a universal digital identity platform that gives every human on Earth a secure, verifiable digital ID. Built on decentralized principles with blockchain-anchored credentials and biometric proofing, it enables identity verification without centralized authorities.

### Key Value Proposition
- Self-sovereign identity: users own and control their digital ID
- Verifiable credentials: W3C-compliant, cryptographically signed, tamper-evident
- Selective disclosure: zero-knowledge proofs reveal only what is needed
- Blockchain anchoring: immutable proof of identity events on Polygon
- Developer-first: SDK and API for easy integration

### Market Context
- $34.5B digital identity market (2024), growing to $83.2B by 2030 (16.2% CAGR)
- Decentralized identity segment growing at 88.7% CAGR
- No platform combines W3C standards + biometric proofing + ZKP + developer API
- Competitors: Worldcoin (crypto-native), Civic (crypto-native), Microsoft Entra Verified ID (enterprise), Polygon ID (crypto-native)

## Vision

8 billion people. One identity standard. Zero central control.

- **Biometric Proofing**: Liveness detection and biometric enrollment (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Immutable proof of identity events on Polygon
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure
- **Interoperability**: W3C DID / VC standards compliance
- **Developer Platform**: API keys, SDK, sandbox, usage monitoring

## Conventions

### Branch Naming
- Branch prefix: `feature/humanid/`, `fix/humanid/`, `arch/humanid/`

### Database
- Database: `humanid_dev` (local), containerized for CI

### API Design Patterns
- RESTful API with versioned prefix: `/api/v1/`
- Zod input validation at route boundary
- Service layer for business logic (no logic in route handlers)
- AppError with RFC 7807 problem details
- Structured logging with request correlation
- All identity data encrypted at rest
- PII handling follows GDPR + CCPA compliance patterns

### Key Domain Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DID | Decentralized Identifier -- globally unique ID owned by the user |
| Verifiable Credential (VC) | Cryptographically signed credential from an issuer |
| Verifiable Presentation (VP) | Holder's response to a verification request |
| Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) | Proof of an attribute without revealing underlying data |
| Wallet | On-device storage for credentials and keys |
| Issuer | Organization that creates and signs credentials |
| Holder | Individual who owns and controls credentials |
| Verifier | Entity that requests and verifies credential presentations |
| Anchor | On-chain hash of an identity event |

### User Roles

- **Holder**: Creates identity, manages credentials, presents to verifiers
- **Issuer**: Issues verifiable credentials to holders
- **Developer**: Integrates verification via API/SDK
- **Verifier**: Verifies presented credentials
- **Admin**: Manages trusted issuers, platform settings, analytics

### Identity Lifecycle
```
Initializing --> BiometricEnrollment --> RecoverySetup --> Active
Active --> Suspended | Recovering | Deactivated
```

### Credential Lifecycle
```
Offered --> Accepted --> Active --> Presented / Revoked / Expired
```

### Security Architecture Summary

- **6 security layers**: Transport, Authentication, Authorization, Data Protection, Infrastructure, Audit
- **OWASP Top 10 mitigations**: All 10 categories addressed
- **Privacy by design**: Biometric templates + private keys NEVER leave device
- **Compliance**: GDPR + CCPA + FIDO2; eIDAS 2.0 in Phase 2
- Full security document: See `docs/security.md`

---

## Business Logic

### Identity Creation Rules
1. One primary DID per user (secondary DIDs allowed for organizational use)
2. Biometric enrollment is mandatory for full identity; face capture + liveness is minimum
3. Recovery setup is recommended but can be skipped (warning persists)
4. DID creation succeeds even if blockchain anchoring is delayed (async anchoring)

### Credential Issuance Rules
1. Only organizations in the trusted issuer registry can issue credentials
2. Credentials must conform to a registered template schema
3. Batch issuance limited to 500 per request
4. Credential offers expire after 7 days if not accepted

### Verification Rules
1. Verification checks (in order): signature, issuer trust, revocation, expiry
2. All four checks must pass for `verified: true`
3. ZKP verification validates proof without accessing underlying data
4. Verification results are logged in audit_logs for compliance

### Blockchain Anchoring Rules
1. DID creation, credential issuance, and revocation trigger anchoring
2. Anchoring is asynchronous -- never blocks the user flow
3. Failed transactions retry up to 3 times with increasing gas
4. After 3 failures, the event is queued for manual retry and an alert is raised

### Rate Limiting
| Tier | Rate Limit | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Sandbox | 100 req/hr | Developer testing |
| Production | 10,000 req/hr | Standard production use |
| Enterprise | Custom | Negotiated per contract |

### Privacy Rules
1. Biometric templates NEVER leave the device
2. Credential claims encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
3. Private keys NEVER leave the device
4. Selective disclosure via ZKP is the default for attribute verification
5. Sharing history tracks all presentations; holders can revoke at any time
