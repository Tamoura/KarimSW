## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

**As a** [persona], **I want to** [action], **so that** [benefit].

[Describe this user journey in plain language — the full flow from the user's perspective, including what they see, what they click, and what happens.]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently — e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
3. **Given** [error/edge state], **When** [action], **Then** [graceful handling]
