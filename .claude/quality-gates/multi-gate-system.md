# Multi-Gate Quality System

**Phase 2 Enhancement + Spec-Kit Integration**: Comprehensive quality verification at multiple stages, now starting with specification consistency.

## Purpose

Catch issues earlier in the development process by running specialized checks at strategic points, not just before CEO review. The Spec Consistency Gate (powered by spec-kit) catches specification-level issues before any code is written or tested.

## Six Quality Gates

```
Spec → Spec Consistency Gate → Browser Gate → Security Gate → Performance Gate → Testing Gate → Production Gate → CEO
              ↓                     ↓               ↓                ↓                  ↓                ↓
          Spec/Plan            Browser         Security        Performance        Quality         Deployment
          Aligned?             Works?          Issues          Issues             Issues          Readiness
```

### -1. Spec Consistency Gate (SPECIFICATION QUALITY) — spec-kit powered

**When**: After task generation, before implementation begins. Also before any CEO checkpoint.
**Purpose**: Verify that spec, plan, and tasks are aligned and constitution-compliant. Catches requirement gaps before code is written.
**Invoked By**: QA Engineer (via `/speckit.analyze`) or Orchestrator automatically

#### Checks

```yaml
Spec Consistency Checks:
  - Spec exists and all sections filled (no empty templates)
  - No unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
  - Every spec requirement (FR-xxx) maps to at least one task
  - Every task maps back to a spec requirement (no orphan tasks)
  - TDD ordering verified (test tasks before implementation tasks)
  - Constitution compliance (all 9 articles checked)
  - Component reuse table references valid registry entries
  - Terminology consistent across spec, plan, and tasks
  - No conflicts between spec entities and data model
  - Port assignments match PORT-REGISTRY.md
```

#### Implementation

```bash
# Run spec consistency gate (via /speckit.analyze)
# This is a read-only audit — it does not modify any files

# Artifacts checked:
# - products/[product]/docs/specs/[feature-name].md
# - products/[product]/docs/plan.md
# - products/[product]/docs/tasks.md
# - .specify/memory/constitution.md
# - .claude/COMPONENT-REGISTRY.md

# Output: products/[product]/docs/quality-reports/spec-consistency-[date].md
```

#### Pass Criteria

```
✅ PASS if:
- All spec requirements covered by tasks
- Constitution compliance: 9/9 articles satisfied
- No CRITICAL or HIGH findings
- Terminology consistent across artifacts

⚠️ WARN if:
- MEDIUM findings exist (terminology inconsistencies, minor gaps)
- Some LOW findings (style, documentation gaps)

❌ FAIL if:
- Any spec requirement has no corresponding task (CRITICAL)
- Constitution violation detected (CRITICAL)
- Unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (CRITICAL)
- Spec-plan conflicts (HIGH)
- TDD ordering violated (HIGH)

BLOCKING: If spec consistency gate has CRITICAL findings, flag for resolution.
Unlike browser-first gate, this does NOT block subsequent gates for existing code,
but MUST pass before CEO checkpoint.
```

---

### 0. Browser-First Gate (FOUNDATIONAL)

**When**: Before ANY other code-level gate. This is the first code-level thing checked.
**Purpose**: Verify the product actually works in a browser. If it doesn't, nothing else matters.
**Invoked By**: Automatically by `testing-gate-checklist.sh` (Phase 1) and orchestrator (Step 4.F)

This gate exists because products consistently showed "clean test status" (unit tests pass) but didn't actually work in the browser. By making browser verification the very first check, we catch the most critical failures immediately.

#### Checks

```yaml
Browser-First Checks:
  - Server startup (API + Web)
  - Health endpoint responds (200 OK)
  - Frontend loads with content (HTML with app root)
  - No placeholder/Coming Soon pages
  - Playwright headless verification (auto-installs if missing)
  - Route navigation (/login, /dashboard)
  - No hydration errors (React SSR/CSR mismatch)
  - No console errors
  - Production build succeeds
  - E2E test files exist (>= 3)
```

#### Implementation

```bash
# Run browser-first gate
.claude/scripts/smoke-test-gate.sh [product]

# Also enforced as Phase 1 of testing gate:
.claude/scripts/testing-gate-checklist.sh [product]
# ^ Phase 1 calls smoke-test-gate.sh. If FAIL → exit 1 immediately.
#   Phases 2-6 are skipped entirely.
```

#### Pass Criteria

```
✅ PASS if:
- Servers start and respond
- Frontend loads with real content
- No placeholder pages
- Playwright verification succeeds
- No hydration errors
- No console errors

❌ FAIL if ANY:
- Server doesn't start
- Frontend returns non-200
- Placeholder/Coming Soon detected
- Hydration errors present
- Console errors present
- Playwright check fails

BLOCKING: If browser gate fails, ALL subsequent gates are skipped.
```

### 1. Security Gate 🔒

**When**: Before creating PR
**Purpose**: Catch security vulnerabilities early
**Invoked By**: Any engineer before PR creation

#### Checks

```yaml
Security Checks:
  - npm audit (frontend + backend)

  - Secret scanning (API keys, credentials)
  - SQL injection patterns (if using raw queries)
  - XSS vulnerability patterns (if rendering user content)
  - Authentication/authorization review
  - Environment variable validation
```

#### Implementation

```bash
# Run security gate
cd products/[product]

# 1. Dependency vulnerabilities
cd apps/api && npm audit --audit-level=high
cd apps/web && npm audit --audit-level=high

# 2. Secret scanning (git-secrets or similar)
git secrets --scan

# 3. Code patterns (custom script or eslint-plugin-security)
npm run lint:security

# Report: PASS/FAIL with details
```

#### Pass Criteria

```
✅ PASS if:
- No HIGH or CRITICAL npm audit vulnerabilities
- No secrets found in code
- No security linting errors

⚠️ WARN if:
- MEDIUM npm audit vulnerabilities (document and proceed)
- Security linting warnings (review and proceed)

❌ FAIL if:
- HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets/API keys
- SQL injection patterns in code
- Missing authentication on sensitive routes
```

#### Output

```markdown

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ⚠️ PASS WITH WARNINGS / ❌ FAIL

### Dependency Audit
- Backend: ✅ No high/critical vulnerabilities
- Frontend: ⚠️ 2 medium vulnerabilities (documented below)

### Secret Scanning
- ✅ No secrets detected

### Code Security
- ✅ No SQL injection patterns

## Gate Execution Flow

### In Task Graphs

Each gate becomes a task in the graph:

```yaml
# Example: New feature workflow with all gates

tasks:
  # ... implementation tasks ...

  - id: "GATE-SECURITY"
    name: "Run Security Gate"
    description: "Check for security vulnerabilities before PR"
    agent: "backend-engineer"  # or frontend, whoever makes PR
    depends_on: ["IMPL-COMPLETE"]
    produces:
      - name: "Security Report"
        type: "document"
        path: "products/{PRODUCT}/docs/security-gate-{DATE}.md"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "No HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities"
      - "No secrets in code"
    status: "pending"

  - id: "PR-CREATE"
    name: "Create Pull Request"
    depends_on: ["GATE-SECURITY"]  # Only after security passes
    # ...

  # ... PR review, merge ...

  - id: "GATE-PERFORMANCE"
    name: "Run Performance Gate"
    description: "Performance benchmarks before staging"
    agent: "devops-engineer"
    depends_on: ["DEPLOY-STAGING"]
    produces:
      - name: "Performance Report"
        type: "document"
        path: "products/{PRODUCT}/docs/performance-gate-{DATE}.md"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Lighthouse Performance >= 90"
      - "Bundle size < 500KB"
    status: "pending"

  - id: "GATE-TESTING"
    name: "Run Testing Gate"
    agent: "qa-engineer"
    depends_on: ["GATE-PERFORMANCE"]
    # ... (already exists from Phase 1)

  - id: "CHECKPOINT-CEO"
    name: "CEO Review"
    depends_on: ["GATE-TESTING"]
    checkpoint: true
    # ...

  # After CEO approval:

  - id: "GATE-PRODUCTION"
    name: "Run Production Readiness Gate"
    agent: "devops-engineer"
    depends_on: ["CHECKPOINT-CEO-APPROVED"]
    produces:
      - name: "Production Readiness Report"
        type: "document"
        path: "products/{PRODUCT}/docs/prod-gate-{DATE}.md"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Monitoring configured"
      - "Rollback plan documented"
      - "SSL configured"
    status: "pending"

  - id: "DEPLOY-PRODUCTION"
    name: "Deploy to Production"
    depends_on: ["GATE-PRODUCTION"]
    # ...
```

### Automatic vs Manual

| Gate | Automatic? | When Run |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Spec Consistency | Automatic | After task generation + before CEO checkpoint |
| Browser-First | Automatic | Before ALL code-level gates (Phase 1 of testing gate) |
| Security | Automatic in CI | On every PR |
| Performance | Automatic | After staging deploy |
| Testing | Automatic | Before CEO checkpoint |
| Production | Manual checklist | Before prod deploy |

### Gate Failures

```markdown
If Browser-First Gate FAILS:
→ Block ALL subsequent gates (security, performance, testing, production)
→ Route to Frontend/Backend engineer to fix
→ Re-run smoke-test-gate.sh
→ Nothing else runs until browser gate passes

If Security Gate FAILS:
→ Block PR creation
→ Engineer must fix and re-run gate
→ No proceeding to next steps

If Performance Gate FAILS:
→ Block staging approval
→ Frontend/Backend engineer optimizes
→ Re-run after optimization
→ Can proceed with CEO approval if urgent

If Testing Gate FAILS:
→ Block CEO checkpoint
→ Route to appropriate engineer
→ Re-run after fixes
→ Must pass before CEO sees it

If Production Gate FAILS:
→ Block production deploy
→ DevOps/Backend fixes issues
→ Re-run checklist
→ Must pass before production
```

## Benefits

### Earlier Issue Detection

| Issue Type | Before (Phase 1) | After (Phase 2) |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Security vuln** | Discovered in production | Caught before PR |
| **Performance** | CEO sees slow app | Caught before staging |
| **Broken tests** | CEO sees errors | Caught before CEO review (already in Phase 1) |
| **Missing monitoring** | Discovered at 3am | Caught before production |

### Cost Savings

```
Security issue in production:
- Time to fix: 4 hours
- Deployment cycle: 2 hours
- Total: 6 hours

Security issue caught at PR:
- Time to fix: 30 minutes
- No deployment needed
- Total: 30 minutes

Savings: 5.5 hours (92%)
```

### Quality Improvement

```
Before Phase 2:
- 1 security issue per product reached production
- 2 performance issues per product discovered post-launch
- 1 production outage due to missing monitoring

After Phase 2:
- 0 security issues reach production
- 0 performance surprises
- 0 outages from infrastructure gaps
```

## Implementation in Orchestrator

Orchestrator automatically adds gate tasks to workflows:

```markdown
When loading task graph template:
1. Insert Security Gate before PR creation
2. Insert Performance Gate after staging deployment
3. Insert Testing Gate before CEO checkpoint (already exists)
4. Insert Production Gate before production deployment

Agents automatically invoked at each gate.
Failures block progression.
Reports stored for audit trail.
```

## Monitoring Gate Effectiveness

Track in `.claude/memory/metrics/gate-metrics.json`:

```json
{
  "security_gate": {
    "runs": 25,
    "failures": 3,
    "failure_rate": 0.12,
    "issues_caught": ["npm audit vuln", "hardcoded API key", "missing auth"]
  },
  "performance_gate": {
    "runs": 20,
    "failures": 2,
    "failure_rate": 0.10,
    "issues_caught": ["bundle too large", "slow API query"]
  },
  "testing_gate": {
    "runs": 30,
    "failures": 5,
    "failure_rate": 0.17,
    "issues_caught": ["failing tests", "UI styling broken", "console errors"]
  },
  "production_gate": {
    "runs": 15,
    "failures": 1,
    "failure_rate": 0.07,
    "issues_caught": ["missing rollback plan"]
  }
}
```

## Spec-Kit Integration Summary

The spec-kit integration adds a **Specification Consistency Gate** as the earliest quality check:

```
/speckit.specify → /speckit.clarify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks → /speckit.analyze (Gate -1)
                                                                              ↓
                                                                    Browser Gate (Gate 0) → ... → CEO
```

**Key benefit**: Catches misalignment between what was specified and what is being built BEFORE any code is written. This eliminates the most expensive category of rework — building the wrong thing.

**Powered by**: `.specify/templates/commands/analyze.md` (command definition)
**Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (governing principles)
**Templates**: `.specify/templates/` (spec, plan, tasks, checklist templates)

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated security fixes**: Auto-create PRs for dependency updates
- **Performance budgets**: Fail if bundle size increases by >10%
- **Visual regression testing**: Catch UI changes automatically
- **Compliance gate**: Check for GDPR, SOC2, etc. requirements
- **Spec regression**: Detect when code changes drift from specifications
- **Cross-product spec analysis**: Validate consistency across all KarimSW products
