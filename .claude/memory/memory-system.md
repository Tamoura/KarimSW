# Agent Memory System

Agents learn from experience and share knowledge across products to become more effective over time.

## Purpose

- **Preserve Context**: Remember what worked, what failed, why decisions were made
- **Avoid Repetition**: Don't make the same mistakes on each product
- **Share Knowledge**: Backend engineer's learning helps next backend task
- **Improve Estimates**: Track actual vs estimated time
- **Build Company Knowledge**: Accumulate best practices

## How Agents Use Memory

### When Assigned a Task

```markdown
1. Orchestrator invokes agent with task

2. Agent reads their memory file:
   Read: .claude/memory/agent-experiences/[agent-name].json

3. Agent checks company knowledge:
   Read: .claude/memory/company-knowledge.json

4. Agent looks for relevant patterns:
   - Filter by category matching task type
   - Check "when_to_use" conditions
   - Apply high-confidence patterns automatically

5. Agent checks for common mistakes:
   - Review mistakes relevant to current task
   - Use prevention checklists

6. Agent executes task with learned context

7. Agent reports back (via AgentMessage protocol)

8. Orchestrator updates agent memory:
   - Add to task_history
   - Update performance_metrics
   - If new pattern discovered, add to learned_patterns
```

### Example: Backend Engineer Using Memory

```markdown
Task: "Implement API foundation for analytics-dashboard"

Backend Engineer reads memory:
- Sees PATTERN-001 about Prisma connection pooling
- Checks: "when_to_use: expected concurrent users > 50"
- Analytics dashboard PRD says: "Expect 500+ concurrent users"
- Decision: APPLY pattern automatically

- Sees common_mistake: "Forgot to add database indices"
- Adds to checklist: Review schema, add indices

- Sees preferred_approach: "Use Fastify error handler"
- Applies pattern from previous work

- Sees efficiency_improvement: "Shared test fixtures"
- Reuses fixtures pattern from previous project

Result:
- Faster implementation (no need to rediscover patterns)
- Higher quality (avoids known mistakes)
- Consistent with other products (same patterns)
```

## Memory Updates

### After Each Task

Orchestrator updates agent memory with:

```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "product": "...",
  "started_at": "...",
  "completed_at": "...",
  "estimated_minutes": X,
  "actual_minutes": Y,
  "status": "success/failure",
  "challenges": ["..."],
  "solutions": ["..."],
  "artifacts": ["..."]
}
```

### When Pattern Discovered

If agent reports a new pattern (in AgentMessage):

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "context": {
      "notes": [
        "PATTERN: Discovered that X approach works better than Y for Z scenario"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Orchestrator:
1. Creates entry in company-knowledge.json
2. Adds to relevant agent's learned_patterns
3. Makes available to all future tasks

### Decision Logging

After CEO checkpoints, Orchestrator logs decision:

```json
{
  "id": "DEC-XXX",
  "date": "...",
  "product": "...",
  "context": "...",
  "decision": "...",
  "options_considered": [...],
  "rationale": "...",
  "outcome": "TBD"
}
```

Later, outcome is updated when impact is known.

## Memory Benefits

| Scenario | Without Memory | With Memory |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **New product setup** | Rediscover Prisma config each time | Apply known pattern instantly |
| **CSS issues** | Debug Tailwind each time | Check common_gotchas, apply fix |
| **Database design** | Forget to add indices | Checklist from common_mistakes |
| **Time estimation** | Always off by similar amount | Adjust based on estimated_vs_actual |
| **Architectural decisions** | Re-debate same tradeoffs | Reference decision-log for consistency |
| **Code patterns** | Inconsistent across products | Learned patterns applied uniformly |

## Memory Maintenance

### Periodic Review

Monthly (automated task):
- Analyze performance metrics
- Identify new patterns (>2 occurrences)
- Promote successful patterns to company knowledge
- Archive old patterns with low confidence
- Update anti-patterns based on failures

### Confidence Scoring

Patterns gain confidence as they're successfully applied:

```
confidence = success_rate * log(times_applied + 1)

Where:
- success_rate = 1.0 means always worked
- times_applied = how many times it's been used
- log dampens the impact of many applications

Levels:
- high: confidence >= 0.9
- medium: 0.6 <= confidence < 0.9
- low: confidence < 0.6
```

High confidence patterns are auto-applied.
Medium confidence patterns are suggested.
Low confidence patterns are available but not pushed.

## Privacy & Security

Memory does NOT contain:
- Actual code (only snippets)
- Sensitive data
- API keys or credentials
- Business secrets
- Customer data

Memory DOES contain:
- Technical patterns
- Process improvements
- Decision rationale
- Performance metrics
- Code structure patterns

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Pattern Detection**: Use LLM to analyze commits and suggest patterns
- **Cross-Company Learning**: Share anonymized patterns with other Claude Code instances
- **Visualization**: Dashboard showing most valuable patterns, agent improvements
- **Automated Onboarding**: New agents read memory to "get up to speed"
- **A/B Testing**: Test old approach vs new pattern, track success rates
