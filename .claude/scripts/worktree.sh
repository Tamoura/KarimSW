# worktree.sh - Manage git worktrees for parallel product development
#
# Usage:
#   ./worktree.sh create <product> [branch]   Create a worktree for a product
#   ./worktree.sh list                        List active worktrees
#   ./worktree.sh remove <product>            Remove a worktree (keeps branch)
#   ./worktree.sh path <product>              Print worktree path
#
# Worktrees are created in <repo>/.tree/<product>/
# Each gets its own branch checkout sharing the same .git database.
# Hooks are inherited automatically from the main repo.
# The .tree/ directory is gitignored.
