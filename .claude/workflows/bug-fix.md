# Workflow: Bug Fix

This workflow ensures every bug fix includes comprehensive testing. **The CEO should NEVER have to ask for user stories or test coverage - it's automatic.**

## Trigger

- CEO reports a bug: "There's a bug in [product] where..."
- "X is not working"
- "When I do Y, nothing happens"
- GitHub issue created with bug label
- Support Engineer escalates an issue

## Prerequisites

- Product exists
- Bug is reproducible (or investigation needed)

## KEY PRINCIPLE

**For EVERY bug fix, these are created AUTOMATICALLY:**

| Artifact | Description | Created By |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| User Stories | For ALL related functionality, not just the bug | Support Engineer |
| Unit Tests | Failing test for bug + tests for related features | Support/Dev Engineer |
| E2E Tests | Browser tests for the scenario | QA Engineer |
| Test Plan | Document in `docs/TEST-PLAN.md` | Support Engineer |

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Triage

```
Step 1.1: Initial Assessment
├── Invoke Support Engineer agent
├── Tasks:
│   ├── Attempt to reproduce
│   ├── Identify affected component
│   ├── Assess severity
│   ├── Document findings
│   └── IDENTIFY ALL RELATED FUNCTIONALITY
└── Output: Bug investigation report

Step 1.2: Prioritize
├── Based on Support Engineer assessment:
│   ├── Critical: Immediate action
│   ├── High: Current session
│   ├── Medium: Next sprint
│   └── Low: Backlog
└── Update issue with priority label

Step 1.3: Route
├── Backend bug → Backend Engineer
├── Frontend bug → Frontend Engineer
├── Infrastructure → DevOps Engineer
├── Unknown → Need more investigation
└── Create/update GitHub issue
```

### Phase 2: Document User Stories (MANDATORY)

```
Step 2.1: Create User Stories for ALL Affected Functionality
├── NOT just the reported bug - ALL related features
├── Example: If bug is "GPU count doesn't update":
│   ├── User story for GPU count field
│   ├── User story for ALL other form fields
│   ├── User story for calculation behavior
│   └── User story for results display
├── Document in: products/[product]/docs/TEST-PLAN.md
└── Format for each:
    ├── As a [user], when I [action], I expect [result]
    └── Acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then

Step 2.2: Root Cause Analysis
├── Why did this happen?
├── When was it introduced?
├── What's the fix scope?
├── What else could be affected?
└── Are there related issues?
```

### Phase 3: Write Tests FIRST (TDD - MANDATORY)

```
Step 3.1: Create Fix Branch
├── Branch from main: fix/[product]/[issue-id]
└── Update state with active task

Step 3.2: Write Failing Unit Tests (BEFORE fixing)
├── Test that reproduces the EXACT bug (MUST FAIL)
├── Tests for ALL related parameters/fields
├── Edge case tests (0, negative, max values)
├── Run tests → Verify they FAIL
└── Commit: "test: add failing tests for #[issue]"

Step 3.3: Write E2E Tests (BEFORE fixing)
├── Playwright test for the bug scenario
├── Tests for related user interactions
├── Visual verification tests
├── Run tests → Verify they FAIL
└── Commit: "test: add E2E tests for #[issue]"

Step 3.4: Implement Fix
├── Invoke appropriate agent (Backend/Frontend)
├── ONLY write code to make failing tests pass
├── Minimal changes - no extra refactoring
├── Run tests → Verify they PASS
└── Commit: "fix: resolve [bug description] #[issue]"

Step 3.5: Full Regression Check
├── Run ALL unit tests: npm run test:run
├── Run ALL E2E tests: npm run test:e2e
├── ALL tests must pass (not just new ones)
└── If any fail → fix before proceeding
```

### Phase 4: Verification

```
Step 4.1: QA Verification
├── Invoke QA Engineer (for high/critical bugs)
├── Tasks:
│   ├── Verify original bug is fixed
│   ├── Test related functionality
│   ├── Add regression test if not covered
│   └── Sign off on fix
└── Update issue with verification status

Step 4.2: Create Pull Request
├── Create PR: fix/[product]/[issue-id] → main
├── PR includes:
│   ├── Summary of the bug
│   ├── Root cause
│   ├── Fix description
│   ├── Test coverage
│   └── Link to issue
└── Run CI

CHECKPOINT: Fix Review (for Critical/High only)
├── Notify CEO: "Bug fix ready for review"
├── Provide: PR link, what was fixed
├── Wait for: CEO approval
└── On approval: Proceed to merge

Note: Medium/Low bugs can be merged without checkpoint
if tests pass and fix is straightforward
```

### Phase 5: Resolution

```
Step 5.1: Merge
├── Squash merge PR to main
├── Delete fix branch
└── Auto-deploys to staging

Step 5.2: Verify in Staging
├── Invoke Support Engineer
├── Verify bug is fixed in staging
└── Report status

Step 5.3: Production (if production bug)
├── If critical: Trigger production deploy
├── Else: Wait for next release cycle
└── Verify in production when deployed

Step 5.4: Close Issue
├── Update issue with resolution
├── Link to PR/commit
├── Close issue
└── Update orchestrator state
```

## Bug Priority Response Matrix

| Priority | Triage | Investigation | Fix | Review |
|----------|--------|---------------|-----|--------|
| Critical | Immediate | 30 min max | ASAP | CEO required |
| High | Same session | 1 hour max | Same session | CEO required |
| Medium | Same session | Can queue | Next sprint | Auto-merge OK |
| Low | Can queue | Can queue | Backlog | Auto-merge OK |
